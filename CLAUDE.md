# TaskFixerAI Website Integration

## Project Overview

This project involves integrating TaskFixerAI, a custom GPT developed by Creative Transformations Consulting through ChatGPT Teams, into a standalone web experience hosted on their Lovable website. The goal is to allow external users to interact with TaskFixerAI without requiring a ChatGPT account.

## Client

Creative Transformations Consulting

## Key Objectives

- Embed the TaskFixerAI GPT into the client's website for public or member-based access
- Enable branded user interaction directly within the Lovable site
- Support eventual monetization or gated access (e.g., via Memberstack + Stripe)
- Provide a proof of concept (POC) demonstrating the integrated chat experience

## Project Phases

### Phase 1 – Discovery & Design (Completed)
- Review of client's existing GPT and access permissions
- Assessment of embedding and API integration options (Typebot, Chatbase, Botsonic, or custom OpenAI API solution)
- Recommendations provided for Option A (No-code) and Option B (Custom integration)

### Phase 2 – Proof of Concept (In Progress)
- Develop a working prototype using the selected method (Option A or B)
- Configure OpenAI API connection and embed logic
- Integrate within Lovable website (Custom HTML block)
- Verify that chat functions properly and reflects TaskFixerAI's system prompt

### Phase 3 – Implementation (Pending Client Approval)
- Deploy production-ready integration
- Set up user access gating (Memberstack + Stripe) if selected
- Conduct functionality testing and user experience validation

## Deliverables

1. Proof of Concept (functional embedded TaskFixerAI chat)
2. Finalized chat interface within client's Lovable website
3. Monetization/gating configuration

## Technical Considerations

- **Integration Options**: No-code solutions (Typebot, Chatbase, Botsonic) vs Custom OpenAI API implementation
- **Platform**: Lovable website with Custom HTML block support
- **Security**: Secure API key management required
- **Monetization**: Potential integration with Memberstack + Stripe for gated access

## Client Responsibilities

- Provide access credentials and related documentation (completed)
- Approve the selected embedding option and any associated subscription tools
- Supply content and design preferences for integration

## Vendor Responsibilities

- Develop and configure the API or no-code integration
- Ensure secure API key management
- Coordinate testing and final deployment
- Provide ongoing technical guidance during setup

## Current Status

Currently in Phase 2 (Proof of Concept) development.
